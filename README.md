# Immutant

Immutant is an application server for Clojure based off of
JBossAS/WildFly. This README covers building Immutant. 
For usage and more details, see http://immutant.org/. 

To file an issue, see https://issues.jboss.org/browse/IMMUTANT

## Requirements

* Maven 3
* Configuration of the JBoss Maven repository in settings.xml


## Dependencies

Immutant depends on polyglot: https://github.com/projectodd/jboss-polyglot

Polyglot is published as a incremantal builds from our CI server. If
you need to make changes to polyglot, you'll need to build it
separately and adjust the `version.polyglot` property in Immutant's
`pom.xml` to use that local snapshot.

## Building

Install the project using the provided settings.xml:

    mvn -s support/settings.xml install

If you will be building the project often, you'll want to
create/modify your own `~/.m2/settings.xml` file.

If you're a regular JBoss developer, see:

* http://community.jboss.org/wiki/MavenGettingStarted-Developers

Otherwise, see: 

* http://community.jboss.org/wiki/MavenGettingStarted-Users

Once your repositories are configured, simply type:

    mvn install

## Testing 

All unit tests will be run during the build process, but tests can be
run independently with the following command:

    mvn -s support/settings.xml test

The integration tests (a.k.a. integs), which are not run as part of
the main build, can be run like this:

    cd integration-tests
    mvn test -s ../support/settings.xml

Or a single integration test can be run like this:

    mvn test -s ../support/settings.xml -Dns=namespace-of-test

where 'namespace-of-test' is the portion of the ns without the
'immutant.integs' prefix.

If you wish to skip the unit tests during the build process (to speed
things up) you can add the `-Dmaven.test.skip=true` option when
running the `mvn install` command.

## Running

To run your local build, set `IMMUTANT_HOME` and the lein-immutant
plugin will use it:

    export IMMUTANT_HOME=/path/to/immutant/build/assembly/target/stage/immutant/
